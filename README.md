d# jetbot
Jetson TX1/TX2 based companion robot using computer vision, ROS, machine learning based object detection, and Kalman filter based tracking.

This repository contains the files that are necessary for a companion robot. I wanted to create something that felt less like a mechanical entity and more like a living being. The robot uses computer vision and machine learning to follow me around when I am holding a tennis ball and also responds to my hand gestures. I created datasets by taking videos of a tennis ball and a set of hand gestures in various angles and then annotating these gestures using OpenCV's CVAT tool (https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat). I then used these datasets to create machine learning networks that could perform object detection in order to track the tennis ball and the various hand gestures.
The plan was to have the robot entirely controlled by a Jetson TX2, but after trying to make this work I ran into difficulties communicating between the motor controllers and the Jetson. I resolved this by using an Arduino as a middleman between the motor controllers and the Jetson. There were many such challenges where I had to find workarounds. 
Even though it is far from a synthetic lifeform, the centerpiece of my vision for the future, this is my first baby step.
